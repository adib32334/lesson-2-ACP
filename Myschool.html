        <i>In 1846, it started as an English medium school called 'Hardinge School' at Mr. F. B. Camp's, the then Deputy Collector
        of the East India Company. On 3 November 1853, it started as a full-fledged English medium school near Kachari (present
        Laboratory School). However, it is no longer an English medium one; it follows the national curriculum of Bangladesh and
        the medium of instruction is Bengali. Bhagawan Chandra Bose, the father of scientist Jagadish Chandra Bose, was the
        first headmaster of the school.</i><br>
